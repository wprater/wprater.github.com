A bit about me.

Suppose I've been a hacker ever since I first gained access to telephony communication back in 1991 when my Father introduced me to the Hayes 2400 BPS modem which was shortly thereafter connected to Prodigy, then Compuserve, and {%img right http://f.cl.ly/items/3I240w2B2Z3e2Q3t3821/p3.jpg 300 200 %} it wasn't long until I ran my own [Hermes BBS](http://www.hermesbbs.com/about/).  And on, and on, and on I went; reverse engineering Macintosh II games, programming languages, 3D art, UNIX, DNS servers, mail servers, web servers, phones, systems, electronics, whatever I couldn't understand.. including life.  

Moving on from Perl, OpenBSD, ipf, Cyrus, etc., now I've found passion in the intersection of business, creativity, engineering, and user experiences.  Call me an entrepreneur, car nut, or all out geek with a serious passion for food, knowledge, society, and mother earth.

Technology moves fast, like I do, which is why, I suppose, I've latched onto it.  Seems like a great fit, even after a bit of soul searching...
